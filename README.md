## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was to build a Tip calculator app using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Process

### 1. HTML
The structure of the HTML page played an important role in how the layout of the tip calculator would turn out to be. 

On top of that, this type of project reminds you of the importance of meaningful semantics - in these regards, I decided to implement the BEM metholody to create classes for my elements that would ease my coding process in CSS and Javascript.

> Main lesson learned: Invest more time in creating meaningful HTML code that'll ease the coding process down the road

### 2. CSS
To code the design offered by Frontend Mentor, I decided to use **SASS** - an **CSS preprocessor** that simplifies the coding process in CSS and helps maintain good coding practices.

The most awkward part of this process was definitely making it responsive. Because I built this habit of focusing on large screens only, implementing a properly responsive design felt a bit rough in the beginning. 

> Main lesson learned: Adopt a mobile-first approach in responsive design 

### 3. Javascript
After finishing the HTML and CSS aspects of the challenge, I turned my attention to the functionality of the app.

Since I wanted to build the app in the most comprehensive manner possible, I decided to adopt **OOP** aka **Object-Oriented Programming** and use **ES6 Classes**.

Through this approach, I was able to easily keep track of the data and its flow, but also update the UI according to the data changes.

This project made me realize how powerful and useful OOP can be and I'll be focusing more on it in the future, since I still don't have as much control over it as I'd like

> Main lesson learned: Identify a programming paradigm that's adequate for your project's goals
